# G26A preregistration — load-bearing emergence: must the target evidence already be decision-effective through composition when the exclusion policy binds? (RQ3)

**DRAFT v2 — NOT FROZEN. NOT TAGGED. NO COMPUTE AUTHORIZED.**
Born 2026-09-24 (v1); **full rewrite to v2 the same day**, ordered by the
user design audit, executed after the HoVer structural audit **PASSED**
(`HOVER_STRUCTURAL_AUDIT_2026-09-24.md`). v1 was banner'd
`DO-NOT-FREEZE` with five mandatory items; all five are now built into this
text (§1 construct, §2 audit findings, §3 padding, §0-O5/§7 ROPE power
requirement, §11 two-phase authority). **This document does not authorize
itself**: no harness until §0 is signed, no design tag until §12A is
complete, no compute until an explicit STATUS flip in the ledger — and
Phase A / Phase B require **two separate flips** (§11).

**Proposed experiment id:** `G26A` / `g26` (name only; the G-series has no
other claim past G24B/G25A).

**v1 banner → v2 resolution map (2026-09-24):**

1. construct `decision relevance established` → **load-bearing emergence /
   compositional activation** — §1;
2. HoVer zero-model structural audit FIRST → **DONE, PASS** — §2;
3. padding = identical filler multiset across the three timings — §3;
4. ROPE δ=1.5 power note mandatory before freeze — §0 O5 + §7; **DONE →
   ruled 2026-09-24: equivalence demoted to secondary characterization,
   primary branches answered by positive gates (CI low > 0 + floor 3.0)**;
5. two-phase authority (selector funnel ≥ 200 or hard stop) — §11.

Parent documents:

- `PAPER_RQ3_CANDIDATE_AUDIT_2026-09-24.md` — six-candidate screen; this is
  the SURVIVOR's design (§2 there; its RQ wording superseded by this §1);
- `HOVER_STRUCTURAL_AUDIT_2026-09-24.md` + `src/audit_hover.py` +
  `results/audits/hover_structural_v1.json` — the data audit of record (§2);
- `PREREGISTRATION_G24A_NATURAL_EVIDENCE.md` — selection-blindness and
  panel discipline this design inherits;
- register claim boundary: exclusion is **inference-time causal-eligibility
  control, never self-labelled "in-context unlearning"**.

## 0. Open items to sign off before the Phase A tag

| # | Item | Proposal (defaults, until overruled) |
|---|---|---|
| O1 | Selector | `mistral-small-24b` computes the gate cells (selection phase), excluded from the pooled four — G24A discipline (no self-conditioning). |
| O2 | Panel | `qwen3-8b`, `gemma3-12b`, `llama31-8b`, `qwen35-9b` (same pooled-4 as G25A). |
| O3 | Main-pass cells | **10** per item: `Y0, YA, YB, YAB` (no-rule, all four, so the single-component gates are re-verifiable **on the panel itself**, not only on the selector) + `EXCL × {T0,T1,T2}` + `ADMIT × {T0,T1,T2}`. |
| O4 | Final n | all gate-passing items in frozen order, **capped at 300**; **split = train, pinned** (§2: 3,642 structural survivors → **3,640 feasible** after the §0 feasibility exclusions; **2,319 title-pair
clusters**, count pinned by test — 18× the S1 floor *before any gate*); sufficiency gate S1: ≥ 200 final items. |
| O5 | Equivalence ROPE — **secondary characterization only; power note done, ruling recorded (2026-09-24)** | δ = 1.5 raw rating points. **Equivalence never decides a branch** (user ruling; the zero-model O5 note §7 showed why: at design n equivalence power is 70%/20% under reasonable noise constants and 0% under the effect-scale analog — an underpowered test must not be a headline classifier). Primary questions are answered **only** by positive-effect gates: cluster-bootstrap CI low > 0 **and** point ≥ the project floor **3.0** (G23A/G24A/G25A discipline). Secondary role of δ: if a primary's CI *happily* fits ⊆ [−1.5, +1.5], the report may add "compatible with negligible gain"; if it does not fit, nothing is said and **no branch changes — never `unresolved`**. Consequently "≈ 0" may be written only under a *satisfied* secondary ROPE, and not-positive is written "no detectable effect", never "equivalent to zero". δ = 1.5 and n ≤ 300 / C ≤ 300 pinned as-is (options of raising δ to 4.19 or the cap to 856 explicitly rejected — statistics must not redefine the scientific semantics of "no load-bearing gain"). |
| O6 | Panel usability floor | per model: `s·(Y_AB − Y_0) ≥ 5` raw points (chain effect measurable on that model), else unusable for that model only, reported `n/n_total`. |
| O7 | Distance window | rule→judgment token distance equal across T0/T1/T2 **within ±10 tokens**, realized by **repositioning one shared filler multiset** (§3); asserted by test. |
| O8 | Cluster key | HoVer decomposition **title path** (page pair) for the bootstrap. |
| O9 | Seed / Phase A size | seed `20260924`; Phase A pool pinned at **N_A = 3,640** = 3,642 train-split structural survivors (audit `T6_post_rule_funnel.by_split.train`) minus the **2 filler-feasibility exclusions** of the §0 feasibility-gate amendment (tokenizer-geometry, zero-model, outcome-blind; pool sha256 `ad0ac715…0a7e2c95c`). |

**O1–O9 signed by the user on 2026-09-24** (v2 wording included; O5 per the
same-date ruling recorded in §0 O5 / §7 / §8; every item signed unchanged).
§12A box 1 is ticked accordingly — from here the freeze path is
implementation + tests → full suite green → Phase-A design tag → STATUS
flip #1 (the document does not authorize itself; each gate stays its own
record).

**Pre-tag corrections, user-ruled 2026-09-24 (implementation audit):**
(a) O3's "**11** cells" was a **typo for 10** — the enumeration
(`Y0, YA, YB, YAB` + `EXCL × {T0,T1,T2}` + `ADMIT × {T0,T1,T2}`) is
correct and complete (every §5/§6/O6 quantity is computable from those
ten; no estimand references an eleventh cell; the "11" carried over
unchanged from v1); O3 / O6 / §9.9 / §11 / §12B restated to 10 cells and
Phase B ≤ 14,400 rows (12,000 + 2,400). (b) Rule-probe timing pinned to
**T0** (§3). Both before the Phase-A tag.

**Filler-feasibility-gate amendment, user-ruled 2026-09-24 (pre-tag,
zero-model, outcome-blind):** the frozen FILLER_BANK v2 census of O9's
3,642 structural survivors left **2 items unfurnishable** inside the O7
±10 window under the frozen deterministic algorithm + frozen search
budget — uids `3dbe1a3e-b448-4dc0-b1d6-2e3a2ada88bc` and
`4b84c748-0cf2-4981-b526-bab6e8759040` (Georgian-script evidence: a
tokenizer-geometry outlier; best-effort exact distance vector
`llama31-8b = 13 > 10` on both arms, recorded in the pool report).
Ruling: **freeze the feasibility criterion, not 100% coverage.** A
pre-tag, outcome-blind **filler-feasibility gate** now applies: an item
enters the Phase-A pool only if the frozen bank + frozen search budget
furnish it within ±10 across 4 tokenizers × both rule arms × T0/T1/T2;
items that cannot are excluded **deterministically** as
`tokenizer_geometry_infeasible` with their exact best-effort distance
vectors recorded, and never enter the pool. Consequences: **O9 / §11 —
N_A = 3,640** (3,642 structural − 2 excluded), Phase A rows =
3,640 × 4 = **14,560** (the §11 authorization ceiling becomes
≤ 14,560 rows). Exclusion depends only on tokenizer geometry: zero model
forwards exist or were consulted, no Y0/YA/YB/YAB or rule-cell outcome
is involved or could be, and both excluded IDs are recorded here and in
`data/items/g26_phasea_pool_report_v1.json`. From the Phase-A tag
onward the bank **and** the search criterion are frozen — no added
filler sentences, no ±10 relaxation, no item-specific or per-model
filler, no post-tag criterion edits. Pool sha256
`ad0ac715a609f49f9ad98af5cf6a3022a1b1e6f904d7a1f22ae2d490a7e2c95c`.

## 1. Scientific question (construct: load-bearing emergence)

> **RQ3: Does prospective exclusion require the target evidence merely to be
> present, or must it already be load-bearing through composition when the
> policy is processed?**

Two-hop chain `A + B ⇒ claim` where neither component alone suffices — and
"alone insufficient" is not an assumption but the **selection gates'
observable** (§5: `s·(Y_AB − Y_0) ≥ 15` while `|Y_A − Y_0| ≤ 5` and
`|Y_B − Y_0| ≤ 5`). The final context is identical across timings; only the
state of A when `RULE(A)` is processed differs — absent / present but not
load-bearing / already load-bearing:

```text
T0: RULE → A → B → judgment      # A not yet present when the policy is processed
T1: A → RULE → B → judgment      # A present; A alone cannot move the decision (gates 2–3)
T2: A → B → RULE → judgment      # A already load-bearing through the A∘B composition
```

Rule→judgment token distance is equalised within ±10 (O7) by repositioning
**one shared filler multiset** across the three timings (§3) — no
timing-unique pad block.

Why the wording is *load-bearing* and not *relevance* (v1 banner item 1):
the gates show `A alone is not behaviorally effective` — **not** that the
model fails to recognise A's topical relevance (the claim is visible from
the start, so topical relevance may be recognised while A still cannot move
the verdict). Claims therefore speak about exactly what the observables
show — compositional activation — and the headline contrast **T1 vs T2
holds both sides' evidence present**, defeating the one-liner "present is
obviously easier" (only the composition state differs there).

| Account | Predicts |
|---|---|
| **presence-bound** | `T1 ≈ T2 ≫ T0` — mere presence of A suffices for the policy to bind |
| **load-bearing-bound** | `T2 ≫ T1 ≈ T0` — A must already be decision-effective through composition → **the non-obvious headline** |
| **staged** | `T2 > T1 > T0` — binding builds progressively |
| **timing-insensitive** | all equal — under multi-hop composition the timing structure disappears |

**No account is entailed by the manipulation** (triviality gates 1–4
preflight, §10): the manipulation moves *when the rule is processed relative
to composition emergence*; which state the model actually needs is written
nowhere in the visible content. The headline lives in **T1 vs T2** — the one
contrast no "obvious" story settles.

## 2. Data — HoVer v1.1, structural audit PASSED (2026-09-24)

- **Source pin:** HoVer release v1.1 (Findings EMNLP 2020,
  `2020.findings-emnlp.309`): train/dev/test claims JSONs +
  `wiki_wo_links.db` (2,156,273,664 B, frozen 2020-11-03); sha256s in
  `data/external/source_manifest.json` entry `hover_v1.1`; **CC BY-SA 4.0**.
  **Test split blind** — never read; the audit used train + dev only.
- **Record:** `src/audit_hover.py` →
  `results/audits/hover_structural_v1.json`; report
  `HOVER_STRUCTURAL_AUDIT_2026-09-24.md` (verdict **PASS**; MuSiQue
  fallback **not triggered and not armed**).
- **Funnel:** 6,912 two-hop candidates → 6,832 materialized → 4,270
  orientation-unique → **4,105 survivors / 2,683 title-pair clusters
  (2,710 hpqa)** = 13.4× the S1 floor of 200.
- **Page coverage:** 9,189/9,189 claims resolve after the raw→NFD→NFC
  lookup chain (the 249 initial misses were diacritic normalisation
  mismatches; true missing pages = 0).
- **Sentence reconstruction `smart_sents` v2** (abbreviation-aware; never
  splits at single-letter initials) validated by gold-vs-rotated controls —
  gold sentences recalled 0.536 / bridge 0.609 vs rotated 0.283 / 0.166
  (S-label), 0.488 / 0.728 vs 0.264 / 0.203 (NS) — a 3.6–3.7× separation —
  and beats v1-naive on both metrics, both labels (record-of-truth note in
  the JSON).
- **Structural exclusions:** 80 out-of-bridge (1.16%); 77 with
  single-sentence leak recall ≥ 0.9 (36 at 1.0); selector constants
  `R2: 8..80 words`, `R3: leak < 0.9`.
- **Orientation:** chain order follows supporting-fact **mention direction**
  `sf0→sf1` (61.4% of oriented items); list order equals chain order in
  98.2% of oriented items — **75 orientation-unique items are
  list-order-reversed; 72 survive the pooled structural gates; 69 occur in
  the pinned train / Phase-A feasible pool (both feasibility-excluded
  Georgian twins are forward)** → A/B assignment is always by mention
  direction, never by list order (test-asserted, §9.3). *(factual erratum,
  pre-tag 2026-09-24: the v1 sentence "75 survivors are reversed"
  conflated the orientation-unique stage with the survivor stage; selection
  is unchanged.)*
- **Defect taxonomy** (one-by-one read of a 20-item deterministic sample:
  0 fragments / 0 misalignments in survivors): Class A splitter drift
  (fixed by `smart_sents` v2, e.g. uid `71006039`); Class B DB page shorter
  than annotation time (no bridge → drops out); Class C claim/gold noise —
  uid `961688da` (claim labelled SUPPORTED contradicts its own gold
  sentence): **recorded as gold noise, excluded from the candidate pool by
  the gates, original data never modified, human judgment never substituted
  for gold** (user ruling).
- **Split pin (O4/O9): TRAIN ONLY** — 3,642 survivors / 2,320 title-pair
  clusters / 2,339 hpqa clusters (dev 463 / 368 / 371 stays untouched as a
  potential future replication pool). Drawing within one split makes
  cross-split cluster overlap structurally impossible; clustering keys are
  hpqa_id / title-pair (O8).
- The selection phase **never contains an exclusion rule of any kind** (user
  design constraint, enforced in code + test).

## 3. Items and conditions

**No-rule cells (selection + panel):**

```text
Y0   BACKGROUND → judgment
YA   BACKGROUND → A → judgment
YB   BACKGROUND → B → judgment
YAB  BACKGROUND → A → B → judgment
```

**Rule cells (panel only), rule = one of two byte-fixed sentences
(bytes pinned at implementation, 2026-09-24, both G24A-lineage constants
with the label `evidence A`; frozen from the §12A tag):**

```text
EXCL(A):  "Evidence A is excluded. Evidence A must not influence your final judgment."
ADMIT:    "Evidence A is admitted. It must be given the full weight of a verified item in your final judgment."
```

```text
EXCL_t / ADMIT_t  for t ∈ {T0, T1, T2}:   content byte-identical to §1;
the rule sentence is the only content variable in position; the three
timings share ONE filler multiset — only filler positions move, so
rule→judgment distance lands within ±10 tokens (O7). No timing-unique PAD
block exists (v1's trailing-PAD T2 layout is retired).
```

- Rule sentences are **character-identical across timings** (position is the
  only variable; construction constant + byte test).
- **Rule probes (I4) — timing pinned 2026-09-24, user-ruled, pre-tag:**
  one probe per rule type per item per model (§11 budget
  ≤ 300 × 4 × 2 = 2,400 rows), each issued on the **T0 layout of its own
  rule type** (rule farthest from the judgment — the strictest rule-
  legibility test); `rule_probe_question` field, YES/NO readout.
- Filler: fixed hand-authored neutral bank, unrelated to claim or pages,
  never LLM-generated; the **multiset (token inventory) is identical across
  T0/T1/T2 — only its placement differs** (tests: multiset equality + ±10
  distance assertion).
- **Filler feasibility (§0 feasibility-gate amendment, 2026-09-24):** an
  item enters the pool only if the frozen bank furnishes it within ±10
  under all 4 tokenizers × both rule arms × T0/T1/T2; the 2
  unfurnishable structural survivors are excluded as
  `tokenizer_geometry_infeasible` (zero-model, outcome-blind; uids in §0).
  Bank + search criterion frozen from the Phase-A tag: no added sentences,
  no ±10 relaxation, no item-specific or per-model filler — ever.
- **A/B assignment follows mention direction** (`sf0→sf1`, §2) — never the
  supporting-facts list order (test-asserted).
- Same question, output spec, answer format, 0–100 readout across all cells
  (test), per G0/G24A conventions.

## 4. Models (O2)

Pooled primary: `qwen3-8b`, `gemma3-12b`, `llama31-8b`, `qwen35-9b`.
Selector (O1) runs Phase A only; excluded from pooled inference; reported as
reference. No other model, site, layer, carrier.

## 5. Selection rule (no-rule cells only — blind by construction)

Gates, evaluated on the **selector's** `Y0, YA, YB, YAB` in Phase A (§11):

1. **chain works:** `s · (Y_AB − Y_0) ≥ 15`;
2. **A alone insufficient:** `|Y_A − Y_0| ≤ 5`;
3. **B alone insufficient:** `|Y_B − Y_0| ≤ 5`.

(`s` = gold-label direction, G0 mapping: TRUE-claim establishing → +1,
refuting → −1; recorded per item at build; analyzer tested both directions.)

- Gates 2–3 kill the classic *"your two-hop is really one-hop"* shortcut at
  selection, before any exclusion output exists — and they are precisely
  what makes "present, not load-bearing" (T1) an **observable** label (§1).
- Eligible items taken in **frozen HoVer train order**, no quotas (single
  corpus, label balance reported descriptively), cap O4 = 300.
- Selector blindness: Phase A provably contains no `EXCL`/`ADMIT` cell
  (kind check + test). No outcome of the experiment exists at selection
  time.
- Panel usability (O6) applied **per model** on the panel's own cells (main
  pass), reported `n/n_total`, never used to drop items post hoc.

## 6. Estimands

Per item × model, raw sign-aligned rating points (house primary metric):

```text
R_t = s · ( Y_EXCL_t − Y_B )      leakage of A at timing t
      (ideal exclusion = 0: B stays admissible, so Y_B is the counterfactual — not base)

PG  = R_T0 − R_T1                 PresenceGain:  presence of A at binding
LG  = R_T1 − R_T2                 LoadGain:      load-bearing emergence at binding
```

(`PG`/`LG` rename v1's `CG`/`RG` to match the §1 construct.) `R_t > 0` =
excluded A still pulls toward gold; `R_t < 0` = over-suppression relative to
the B-only counterfactual (reported, not clipped).

**Admit-timing control:** `M_t = s · ( Y_ADMIT_t − Y_AB )` — with the chain
fully admissible, timing per se should not move judgments (`M_t ≈ 0`). A
timing slope in `M` means generic rule-position/recency structure →
integrity flag I3 (§8) plus pre-registered sensitivity
`R̃_t = R_t − M_t` (difference-in-differences), reported alongside
regardless. Usability (O6): all 10 cells present for that model and
`s·(Y_AB − Y_0) ≥ 5`.

## 7. Frozen inference

- **Cluster bootstrap** over title paths (O8): resample K clusters with
  replacement, all their rows (items × models) move together; `B = 10,000`,
  percentile 95% CIs, two-sided `boot_p`, `seed = 20260924`.
- **Branch decision procedure (user ruling 2026-09-24 — positive gates
  decide; equivalence never does):** a primary is **positive** iff its
  cluster-bootstrap CI low > 0 **and** its point estimate ≥ the project
  substantive floor **3.0 raw points**; **negative** iff CI high < 0;
  otherwise **not positive** — a complete three-way for *claims*, where
  not-positive licenses only "no detectable effect". Equivalence
  (CI ⊆ [−δ, +δ], O5 δ = 1.5) is a **secondary characterization**: when a
  CI *happily* fits, the report may add "compatible with negligible
  gain"; it never selects a branch, never vetoes one, and its failure
  never yields `unresolved` (the O5 power note established exactly this:
  equivalence at design n is underpowered, so it cannot be a headline
  classifier). Branch table §8 is evaluated in order mechanical
  completeness (no verdict on partial data) → integrity → sufficiency →
  branches **on the positive gates alone**. Claims never
  exceed the branch that actually fired; "≈" in any published sentence
  maps to a *satisfied* secondary ROPE — never to "p > .05" and never to
  a straddling CI.
- Strata reported: pooled-4, per model, label direction (establish/refute),
  per timing. No item removed after results exist; reruns only for
  mechanical incompleteness.
- **ROPE δ=1.5 power note — MANDATORY before the Phase A tag (O5; v1 banner
  item 4).** Zero-model, G25A-O7 pattern (script → JSON → prose recorded
  here). **Standing algebra the note must resolve:** equivalence is only
  *declarable* when the CI half-width < δ, i.e. `1.96 · SE < 1.5`. Taking
  the frozen G23A Δ_zero constant (half-width 4.47 at 68 clusters — a
  four-cell contrast) as a conservative upper bound gives `C > 604` clusters
  to declare equivalence — **impossible at cap 300**. But `PG`/`LG` are
  two-cell contrasts with strictly smaller variance, so the binding
  constants must come from a **two-cell frozen CI** (G23A Gap CIs / G24A
  cell-level CIs on natural materials). The note must state (a) the
  declarable half-width at n ≤ 300 / C ≤ 300 under the two-cell constants,
  (b) the verdict on δ=1.5 vs the noise floor, (c) if δ or n must move:
  **user decision before the Phase A tag — never after outcomes exist.**
  - **O5 note RECORDED (2026-09-24, zero-model; `src/note_g26a_rope_power.py`
    → `results/audits/g26a_rope_power_note_v1.json`).** Inputs are
    citation-asserted at runtime against the frozen files: G23A Δ_zero
    [4.385, 13.327] @68 clusters (half-width 4.471 → the ">604" citation
    above reproduces at C=605), the two-cell Gap CIs @68, G24A pooled-4
    cell CIs @469 clusters (median |L| = 32.693).
    **(a)** Declarable half-width at the C ≤ 300 cap (SE ∝ C^-1/2):
    gap_atten 0.87 ✓ / gap_w025 0.92 ✓ / gap_w050 0.96 ✓ / gap_w100
    0.98 ✓ / gap_w001 1.33 ✓ / **gap_w000 2.53 ✗** (declarability alone
    needs C=856); natural-materials cross-check (G24A REI cells → raw
    points via median |L|, assumption-flagged): 2.56–3.67 ✗. At the
    S1-min scale C=200 only gap_atten…gap_w100 stay declarable
    (1.07–1.20); gap_w001 is 1.63 ✗.
    **(b)** Verdict on δ=1.5: declarable at cap-300 under the at-null and
    local constants, but equivalence **power at a true zero** is
    84% / 79% / 73% / 70% / 20% (gap_atten / gap_w025 / gap_w050 /
    gap_w100 / gap_w001) and **0%** under the effect-scale closest analog
    gap_w000 and under the G24A cross-check — only gap_atten clears the
    80% target. Mapping PG/LG → a specific weight-cell constant is not
    one-to-one; the grid deliberately spans effect-scale (gap_w000) to
    at-null (gap_w100) so the binding choice is visible, not smuggled.
    **(c)** Options priced, NO decision taken: (1) keep δ=1.5 with
    at-null/local binding — power 70%–20%, under the 80% target, so a
    reviewer's "powered for equivalence?" answer stays <80%; (2) raise δ
    to 4.19 raw points for ≥80% under the closest analog — weakens any
    "≈0" sentence to a 4.2-point band and δ=1.5 never appears in a claim;
    (3) raise the cap to C=856 for declarability alone — 80% power still
    needs C=2340, infeasible, priced here only for honesty. **δ/n
    outcome — USER DECISION MADE (2026-09-24): options (1), (2), (3) all
    REJECTED.** (2) was rejected on semantic grounds — inflating δ to 4.19
    would let "no load-bearing gain" mean "a 4.2-point gain still counts
    as none", i.e. statistics redefining the scientific claim, which a
    reviewer catches more easily than underpower. The note's real product
    is therefore a prereg correction: **equivalence is demoted out of the
    primary branch** (§7 procedure, §8 table — rewritten this date);
    primaries are answered by positive gates (CI low > 0 + floor 3.0);
    δ = 1.5 stays pinned at its secondary characterization role;
    n ≤ 300 / C ≤ 300 unchanged (no δ inflation, no cap inflation).
    §12 O5 box hereby closable.**

## 8. Outcome map

Order: **mechanical completeness (checked first — produces NO verdict,
exit 4) → evaluability (no evaluable rows → `unresolved`; absent data is
never an integrity verdict, G25A order) → I-gates (structural I1/I2 →
rule-legibility I4 → order I3) → S-gates → branches.**

- **Mechanical completeness (user ruling 2026-09-24, pre-tag):** the Phase-B
  analyzer asserts the model-tag set **exactly equals the frozen pooled-4**
  (`qwen3-8b / gemma3-12b / llama31-8b / qwen35-9b`) and that every selected
  item × 4 models × 10 cells exists with parsed values, both probe rows exist
  per item × model with parsed YES/NO readout, and the item set equals the
  frozen selection (an extra/unknown model or duplicate row is *structural*,
  exit 3; a missing pooled model or missing/unparsed required rows or probes
  is *mechanical*, exit 4). Mechanical gaps are rerunnable (§7); **no
  scientific verdict is ever computed from partial data.**
- **I1** rule sentences byte-identical across timings; **I2** shared-filler
  multiset equality + distance assertion (±10 tokens) — construction
  invariants: a failure is a **`structural-integrity-failure`** (NO CLAIM —
  an implementation violation, never a "scientific" effect);
- **I3** admit-timing control: `M_T0 − M_T2` CI contains 0 (else
  `order-artifact` — the only gate that licenses that verdict: recency/
  position structure);
- **I4** rule legibility: probes complete on both rule types but RuleAcc
  < 0.8 on either → **`rule-legibility-failure`** (NO CLAIM — the rule was
  not reliably read; this is an integrity failure, NOT a position artifact;
  missing/unparsed probes never reach here — they are mechanical, exit 4).
  When several I-gates fail together the report lists all of them and the
  verdict label priority is **structural → rule-legibility → order**;
- **S1** ≥ O4-min items (200) usable on **≥ 3 of the frozen pooled-4**
  models (O6). The threshold is fixed at **3** — never adapted to the
  number of models actually observed (Phase B asserts the model set is the
  pooled-4, so "3 of 4" cannot silently degrade).

| Verdict | Conditions (**positive gates only**: CI low > 0 **and** point ≥ 3.0) | Meaning / required action |
|---|---|---|
| `staged` | I✓ S✓; **PG positive** **and** **LG positive** | binding builds in stages; both layers matter |
| `load-bearing-bound` | I✓ S✓; **LG positive**; PG not positive | **the non-obvious headline:** mere presence is insufficient — making A load-bearing through composition further improves prospective binding. PG's own sentence stays "no detectable presence-stage gain" |
| `presence-bound` | I✓ S✓; **PG positive**; LG not positive | presence adds a benefit; no detectable additional load-bearing effect (never "composition state irrelevant" — that would need a satisfied ROPE, not a null) |
| `no-stage-gain` | I✓ S✓; PG and LG both not positive | no detectable stage-specific gain. Subdivided by leakage state below; each not-positive label is written "no detectable …", never "equivalent to zero" |
| ↳ `timing-insensitive / flat-leaky` | `no-stage-gain` + pooled `R` **positive** | composition erases the timing structure while leakage persists |
| ↳ `exclusion-robust` | `no-stage-gain` + **every `R_t` CI ⊆ [−1.5, +1.5]** — the secondary ROPE must be *satisfied* because the label's "excluded cleanly" sentence is an equivalence claim (user ruling: "equivalent to zero" only when the CI really fits the secondary ROPE). `R_t` non-positive but CI ⊈ ±1.5 → stays plain `no-stage-gain` + "no detectable leakage at any timing" | chains are excluded cleanly at every timing — sharp contrast with single-hop G24A leak; equally publishable, honestly unexpected |
| `non-monotone` | any primary **negative** (CI high < 0) | report as measured; no ordering claim |
| `structural-integrity-failure` | I1 or I2 fails | construction invariant violated (rule bytes / shared-filler ±10) — implementation-level NO CLAIM; never interpreted as an order effect |
| `rule-legibility-failure` | probes complete, RuleAcc < 0.8 on either rule type | integrity NO CLAIM — the rule was not reliably read; never `order-artifact`, never a branch |
| `order-artifact` | I3 fails | recency/position structure (admit-timing control) — no claim until explained via `R̃` |
| `unresolved` | S1 fails, or evaluable data/labels absent | report everything; no verdict. **Equivalence failure is NOT a path into `unresolved`** (user ruling 2026-09-24 — the old "neither positive nor equivalent" row condition is deleted) |

**Secondary characterization line (ships alongside any verdict, never
changes it):** any estimand whose CI ⊆ [−1.5, +1.5] may additionally be
described as "compatible with negligible gain"; a CI that does not fit
 licenses no wording at all — a straddling CI is silence, not equivalence.

Every row is reachable a priori; none is the manipulation's built-in answer
(gates 3–4, §10).

## 9. Controls and integrity checks

1. Rule identity across timings (byte test) — position is the only content
   variable.
2. **Shared filler multiset** across T0/T1/T2 (multiset-equality test) +
   distance assertion ±10 tokens (O7); hand-authored bank only, no LLM
   generation.
3. **Mention-direction orientation** test: A/B follow `sf0→sf1`; the 75
   orientation-unique list-order-reversed items (72 pooled structural
   survivors, 69 in the pinned train / Phase-A pool — both feasibility
   exclusions are forward) must construct A/B by mention direction, never
   list order.
4. **Single-split assertion:** every selected item is from `train`
   (O4/O9) — a cross-split draw is structurally impossible.
5. Admit-timing control (I3) + DiD sensitivity `R̃` reported
   unconditionally.
6. Selection blindness: no rule cell in Phase A (kind check + test); gates
   computable only from `Y0/YA/YB/YAB`.
7. Single-component gates re-verified on the panel's own no-rule cells (O3)
   and reported — the shortcut objection is answerable with panel data.
8. Sign convention tested both directions (establish/refute labels).
9. Same readout/output spec across all 10 cells (test).
10. Cluster integrity in the bootstrap (test).
11. Disjointness from G0/G24A item ids (trivially true — different corpora —
    asserted anyway; dedup recorded).
12. **No scope creep:** no new site/layer/carrier/model; no LLM-generated
    materials; MuSiQue path not armed (structural audit PASS).
13. **Wording:** inference-time causal-eligibility control; never "in-context
    unlearning", never generic "representation-vs-deployment" (ACL 2026 Main
    owns that frame).

## 10. Relation to nearest prior (triviality gates)

Five-gate preflight for this design:

1. **Treatment ≠ answer:** the manipulation is *when the rule is processed
   relative to composition emergence*; no text states which state binding
   needs. **PASS.**
2. **Reviewer one-liners blocked:** "rule recency" → distance equalisation +
   shared filler multiset + admit-timing control + DiD (I3/§6); "present
   must obviously suffice" → that is only the presence-bound branch,
   coequal with load-bearing-bound, staged, and flat — none derivable from
   the prompt. **PASS.**
3. **Two+ live accounts under identical visible content:** presence-bound vs
   load-bearing-bound (+ staged/flat), same final context, four live
   branches. **PASS.**
4. **Unexpected-result requirement:** `exclusion-robust`, `flat-leaky`,
   `non-monotone` and both orders of PG/LG are all publishable surprises.
   **PASS.**
5. **Nearest prior:** verified by direct fetch —
   `2024.acl-long.550` (latent composition *capability*),
   `2026.acl-long.1937` (multi-hop failure = locate vs integrate),
   `2026.findings-acl.57` (later clarification reinterprets an
   already-processed word). **None asks whether a policy stated before its
   target is load-bearing through composition can bind it for a later
   judgment.** KILLed neighbours (hop depth, post-training origin,
   scope/collateral, inferential closure) catalogued in
   `PAPER_RQ3_CANDIDATE_AUDIT_2026-09-24.md` §1/§6.
   **Freeze-time manual pass for RQ3 phrasings COMPLETED 2026-09-24:**
   arXiv 5 query families — `evidence exclusion`/`exclude evidence` (3),
   `exclusion policy`+LLM (1), `load-bearing`+evidence (33),
   `(multi-hop|two-hop)`+exclusion (23), `instructed`+evidence+
   (`ignore`|`exclude`) (32) = **92 hits, all read individually — zero
   owners** (nearest classes: instructed-ignoring of presentation cues in
   LLM-as-judge debiasing; agent context-eviction = system memory
   management; both different objects) — plus the shared ACL-2026
   event-listing screen (6,422 titles / 6,365 abstracts; its T3 patterns
   included `prospective`, `ignore … evidence`, `evidence …
   ordering|timing|sequence`, `instructed weight`; record:
   `gate5_novelty_search.md` §"Freeze-time manual pass", coverage caveats
   recorded there). **PASS — residual closed.**

## 11. Authorization boundary — TWO-PHASE (v1 banner item 5)

**Phase A — selector only:**

- Scope: `Y0, YA, YB, YAB` × **N_A = 3,640** train feasible survivors
  (3,642 structural − 2 filler-feasibility exclusions, §0 amendment) ×
  1 model (O1) = **14,560 rows**. No rule cell of any kind (blind by
  construction).
- After the run: **freeze the output file (sha256 computed before any
  gate)**, require exactly the 4 no-rule kinds with **exactly one parsed
  row per item × kind** (any missing/duplicated/unparsed row is
  *mechanical* incompleteness → rerun, never analyzed partially), compute
  the §5 gates, record the funnel (n passing 0/1/2/3 gates).
- **≥ 200 gate-passing →** take items in **pool-file order** (frozen O9
  order — never sorted by an outcome or effect size), cap 300 (O4),
  record selected item IDs + sha256 in §12B → then request **STATUS flip
  #2**.
- **< 200 gate-passing → HARD STOP.** No threshold loosening, no dev-split
  switch, no MuSiQue rescue, no new corpus. Escalate to the user as a
  project-level decision; any change requires a prereg amendment **before**
  any further compute.
- **STATUS flip #1** authorizes exactly Phase A (≤ 14,560 rows) — nothing
  else.

**Phase B — the actual RQ3 experiment:** ≤ 300 selected × 10 cells ×
4 models = 12,000 rows + rule probes ≤ 300 × 4 × 2 = 2,400 →
**≤ 14,400 rows**. Requires **STATUS flip #2**, recorded only after §12B's
Phase-A output boxes are filled.

**Two separate STATUS flips; one flip never authorizes both.**
Sequence: user signs §0 (incl. the v2 wording and the O5 plan) →
implementation + tests → §12A complete → **Phase A design tag** → flip #1 →
Phase A run → funnel + selection recorded → flip #2 → Phase B run → frozen
analyzer, one-shot verdict.

No retries-by-outcome; no fifth model; budgets stated up front — the flip
authorizes exactly them.

## 12. Freeze checklists (two-phase; design immutable from each tag)

**§12A — Phase A tag:**

- [x] §0 open items O1–O9 signed off (incl. user sign-off of the v2 wording) — DONE 2026-09-24: user signed all nine items unchanged (O5 per same-date ruling; ledgered in STATUS)
- [x] **ROPE O5 power note completed (zero-model; §7 + `results/audits/g26a_rope_power_note_v1.json`) and its outcome pinned — per user ruling 2026-09-24: options 1/2/3 rejected; equivalence DEMOTED from primary-branch requirement to secondary characterization ("compatible with negligible gain" only when a CI ⊆ ±1.5); primary gates = CI low > 0 + floor 3.0; δ = 1.5 (secondary role) and n ≤ 300 / C ≤ 300 unchanged; §7 procedure + §8 table rewritten accordingly**
- [x] HoVer structural audit recorded — sha256 / license / funnel / by-split (done 2026-09-24: `hover_v1.1` manifest, `hover_structural_v1.json`, report §5)
- [x] **filler-feasibility census + Phase-A pool written** (done 2026-09-24: 3,642 structural → **3,640 feasible**, 2 excluded as `tokenizer_geometry_infeasible` uids recorded in §0; pool `data/items/g26_phasea_pool_v1.jsonl` sha256 `ad0ac715a609f49f9ad98af5cf6a3022a1b1e6f904d7a1f22ae2d490a7e2c95c`; report `data/items/g26_phasea_pool_report_v1.json`; zero-model, outcome-blind — §0 amendment)
- [x] tests green: rule identity, shared-multiset + ±10 distance, mention-direction orientation, single-split assertion, selection blindness, both sign directions, **positive-gate trichotomy (positive/negative/not-positive) with floor 3.0**, **secondary-ROPE characterization fires wording only — never a branch, never `unresolved`**, outcome-map firing order (`staged`/`load-bearing-bound`/`presence-bound`/`no-stage-gain` + subdivisions, equivalence-failure-is-not-unresolved locked), **Phase-B mechanical/structural taxonomy (missing pooled model / missing rows / missing or unparsed probes → mechanical exit 4 with NO verdict; extra or unknown model / duplicate row / stray kind / rows outside the frozen selection → structural exit 3; selection guards 200 ≤ n ≤ 300, deduped, pool subset; usage without `--selection` → exit 5; complete probes + RuleAcc < 0.8 → `rule-legibility-failure`, explicitly ≠ `order-artifact`; I3 fail with perfect probes → `order-artifact`; S1 threshold pinned at ≥ 3 of the frozen pooled-4, dynamic `min(3,n_models)` absent)** — DONE: `tests/test_g26a.py`, **33 passed / 98.33 s** (incl. deterministic re-run of the 2 feasibility exclusions; rulings 3+4 taxonomy battery)
- [x] full test suite green at updated baseline (**451 passed / 1043.99 s / zero `--ignore` / exit 0** — measured 2026-09-25 after the rulings-3+4 test re-sync; supersedes the interim 445 figure from 2026-09-24 and the earlier 334/849/five-ignore figure; arithmetic: 418 pre-G26A + 33 G26A design tests)
- [x] **Phase A design tag assigned:** `g26a-load-bearing-phasea-design-v1` (recorded here + ledger; annotated tag created on this exact record commit — the tag object binds the SHA; test-sync `ecac51e` passed user review 2026-09-25)
- [ ] **STATUS flip #1 recorded** (ledger: authorizes Phase A ≤ 14,560 rows)

**§12B — Phase A outputs → Phase B authorization (recording only; no design edits):**

- [ ] Phase A output frozen: sha256 + gate funnel (0/1/2/3-gate counts) recorded
- [ ] **funnel ≥ 200 confirmed** (else §11 hard stop)
- [ ] selected item IDs + sha256 (n ≤ 300) recorded
- [ ] **STATUS flip #2 recorded** (ledger: authorizes Phase B ≤ 14,400 rows)

The design is immutable from the §12A tag onward (prereg freeze rule);
§12B admits only the recording of Phase-A outputs and flip #2 — never
design changes.
