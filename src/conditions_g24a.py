"""G24A natural-evidence confirmation (FEVER + SciFact).

The five standard conditions re-rendered over natural materials:

* the background block is the bare **claim** (header ``CLAIM``);
* the critical evidence is the frozen annotated block (header ``EVIDENCE E``);
* the two rulings are the IDBIND-style admit / zero-use pair — one constant
  string each, character-identical between the PRE and the POST arm, so the
  only difference between arms is the position of the rule relative to the
  evidence (preregistration §3).

Dispatch happens on ``item.task_family`` (``g24a_fever`` / ``g24a_scifact``
/ ``g24a_vitaminc`` — Pilot P2's VitaminC pairs) inside ``schema._blocks``;
condition names are the G0 five, so the runner, the rule probes and the G0
estimand plumbing are inherited unchanged.
