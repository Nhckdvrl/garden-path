"""Stage 4A: the same question in a real agent setting.

SYSTEM carries a persistent policy about a document that has not been retrieved
yet; the document arrives later in a TOOL message; the ASSISTANT then answers.
This is the shape of an actual RAG or tool-using agent, and it is where a
prospective information-flow policy would have to work.

The design carries Stage 3E forward rather than being a generic denylist: the
policy varies in how much of the target it specifies (identifier only, gist,
full proposition) and the retrieved document varies in whether it matches the
policy in proposition and in identifier.
