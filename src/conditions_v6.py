"""P0.5 Semantic addressability.

P1-8 showed that a preview of the evidence before the rule restores suppression.
But that preview was the *same string*, so it cannot distinguish

  (a) the rule needs a semantic representation of its target at rule time, from
  (b) the rule only suppresses text it has already seen verbatim.

The preview is now varied along a similarity ladder while the evidence the
decision reads is held fixed, and a 2x2 orthogonally manipulates whether the
later item matches the preview in CONTENT and whether it matches the rule in
symbolic IDENTITY.

Restricted to legal_judgment and evidence_inference, whose critical evidence is
templated, so every rung is authored once per evidence type rather than per item.
