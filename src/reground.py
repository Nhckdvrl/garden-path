"""ReGround: post-retrieval policy grounding.

The decision model receives a prospective identifier policy before retrieval.
ReGround uses a separate short resolver pass after retrieval to match a structured
semantic policy descriptor against the documents that actually arrived. Only the
resolved document IDs are then exposed to the decision model in a trusted exclusion
ledger. The semantic descriptor itself is not copied into the final decision prompt.

G19 uses the frozen G18 items because every one already contains:
- an exact later evidence proposition,
- a paraphrase of that proposition,
- a lexical-overlap / different-proposition hard negative.
